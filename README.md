This is tic-tac-toe web application made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, I have created an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
